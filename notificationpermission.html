<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1>Notifications</h1>
<p>Unless Juggluco is used with Freestyle Libre 0 sensors, Juggluco
must remain active in the background to receive a glucose reading
every minute either directly from the sensor via Bluetooth or via a
network connection. To prevent apps from being killed by Android,
Android requires apps to display a notification so users know the
application is present in the background. The text “To connect with
sensor” or “To exchange data” describes why Juggluco has to
stay active in the background.</p>
<p>Juggluco also uses the notification to display the current glucose
value and a change direction arrow.</p>
