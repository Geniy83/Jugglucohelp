<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1>New Amount</h1>
<p>With <b>New amount</b> you can enter numbers associated with an
arbitrary Label. You can set labels under left menu→Settings→<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/labelhelp.html">Number
Labels</a>. The <i>Amounts</i> entered with a particular label will
be shown at certain hight in the graph determined by the label.</p>
<p>You can later change the amount by long pressing it. You can also
select it from the list of entered amounts under Left middle
menu→List.</p>
<p>It is also possible to receive <b>Insulin</b> dose information
from NovoPen® 6 or NovoPen Echo® Plus by scanning the NFC pen. After scanning
you can change under what label the doses are saved in Juggluco and
restrict doses to doses from <b>after</b> a certain date and time.
When hundreds of doses are present in the memory of the pen, it can
take more than 30 seconds before they are all received via NFC by
Juggluco.</p>
<p>Under Left menu-&gt;Settings-&gt;<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/labelhelp.html">Number
Labels</a> is also specified under which label you enter the
carbohydrates of a meal. In <i>New amount</i>, a <b>Meal</b> button
is displayed  for this label. Tapping this <i>Meal</i> button brings
you to to a <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/mealhelp.html">display</a>
in which you can specify a meal out of its components. The
carbohydrates content is then calculated or you can specify the
carbohydrate content and the needed quantify of one ingredient is
then calculated.</p>
