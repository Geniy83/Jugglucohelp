<h2 class="western">Speak glucose</h2>
<p>Speaks glucose values when they arrive.</p>
<p><b>Seconds between</b>: Specifies how many seconds Juggluco should
wait before saying the next glucose value. Glucose values are always
spoken immediately when they arrive. When a large value is specified,
Juggluco will skip glucose values that arrive before this time period
has elapsed.</p>
<p><b>Voice</b>: Selects a speaker out of a list of possible
speakers.</p>
<p><b>Speed</b>: a higher number means faster talking.</p>
<p><b>Pitch</b>: a higher number means a higher pitch.</p>
<p><b>Test</b>: speaks out the last glucose value.</p>
<p>On some phones the Android settings for text-to-speech have to be
changed for it to work. Sometimes the data of a language has to be
installed or the configuration changed. On Samsung phones &quot;<i>Google
text-to-speech</i>&quot; has to be set instead of &quot;<i>Samsung
text-to-speech engine</i>&quot; in order to choose from different
voices. These options can be found by searching for <i>text-to-speech</i>
in Android settings or going to <i>Language and input
(-&gt;Advanced)-&gt;Text-to-Speech</i>. Here you can select &quot;<i>Speech
Services by Google</i>&quot; and install voice data. In other phones
it is under <i>System settings-&gt;Accessibility-&gt;Vision-&gt;Text-to-Speech
settings</i>.</p>
<h2 class="western">Talk touch</h2>
<p>When <em>talk touch</em> is switched on, touching at certain
places creates talk:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Touching the current glucose;</p>
	<li><p>Touching points of the graphs and scan points;</p>
	<li><p>Touching amounts;</p>
	<li><p>The date of that point of the graph is said, when the upper
	left and right corners are touched;</p>
	<li><p>Long pressing a menu item;</p>
	<li><p>Long pressing an amount in the list of amounts (left middle
	menu-&gt;list).</p>
</ul>
<h2 class="western">Speak messages</h2>
<p>Reads text messages that temporarily visible on the screen and the
result of scanning (error messages and the glucose value).</p>
<h2 class="western">Speak Alarms</h2>
<p>Speaks out the glucose level during Low and High glucose alarms.
It is read both at the start of the alarm as at the moment the alarm
is stopped.</p>
