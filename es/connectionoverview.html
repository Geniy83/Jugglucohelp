<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">On this screen,
after <i>wlan,</i> the local wlan IP of this device is shown, you
should specify this on the other device on you home network you are
connecting to (or your modem if connecting remotely).</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">After <i>Port,</i>
you can change the TCP port this app is listening on for connections.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">By clicking <i><b>Add
connection</b></i> you can specify with which hosts to connect and
how to connect.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">A reliable network
connection is on Android disrupted by all kinds of battery
optimizations and background restrictions, pressing <b>Doze mode</b>
helps you change that.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">If Juggluco
functions as a Mirror app (receiving glucose values from another
device running Juggluco), you can press <b>Alarms</b> to get to a
dialog where you can specify low and high glucose alarms and related
notifications.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Mirror sends
a</b><b>mounts: </b>If the app receives amounts of medication, food
and sport data from this app running on another device, you shouldn't
add or modify these same information here. Checking this makes it
impossible.

Closes existing and creates a new connection.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Wifi</b> (only on
WearOS): When not set WIFI is turned off automatically after some
time by WearOS to preserve battery life and Juggluco switches to the
use of Bluetooth for the connection between phone and watch. When it
is turned on, WearOS is asked to keep WIFI on and it will take longer
before it is turned off, but that can still happen. Setting this
option is normally not needed and the makers of WearOS think that
turning WIFI on will lead to large increases in battery usage.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Existing connections
are shown in a list, the label, the IP port and month, day and time
of the last successful sync are shown.

is used is abbreviated as follows:</p>

<h1>Desktop computer</h1>
<p>You can run the Android Juggluco app on a Windows, Macintosh or
Linux computer with the help of an Android Emulator (for example
<a class="western" href="https://www.genymotion.com/">Genymotion</a>).
The Juggluco on the emulator receives the data via a Mirror
connection from an Android phone connected to the sensor. Pinch
movements (moving two fingers to or from each other) can be simulated
by pressing a key (Control in Genymotion) while moving the mouse
pointer.</p>
