<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1>Libreview</h1>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Juggluco can send
glucose data and amounts to Libreview. When using Libre 0 or 3
sensors, US/CA/AU Libre 2 sensors or other Libre 2 sensors with
<i>Bluetooth History</i> set, Juggluco sends the history values to
Libreview. If Libre 2 sensors are used without &quot;<i>Stream
history</i>&quot;,Juggluco uses the stream data received via
Bluetooth to create these 15 minute points by averaging the stream
values around each point.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Like the Librelink
app, it sends data from the last 89 days to Libreview. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">To
make use of this service, you need to create a Libreview account at
<a class="western" href="https://libreview.com/">https://libreview.com</a>
and specify its E-Mail address and password here.</span> <span lang="en-US">Don't
send data from the same period multiple times to the same Libreview
account (for example from the Librelink app and Juggluco). You can
delete existing devices in Libreview in Account Settings-&gt;My
devices or you can take a new Libreview account.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><span lang="en-US">To
turn it on, you also need to check &quot;</span><span lang="en-US"><i><b>Send
to libreview</b></i></span><span lang="en-US"><i>&quot;</i></span><span lang="en-US">.
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Juggluco will send
new data to Libreview every time you switch away from Juggluco when
it wasn't done in the previous 20 minutes. You can also manually send
it to Libreview by pressing <i>&quot;</i><i><b>Send now</b></i><i>&quot;</i>.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Beside glucose
values, amounts can also be sent to Libreview. For this you need to
touch &quot;<i><b>Send amounts</b></i>&quot; and specify what each
label means.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Immediate</b>:
Send glucose values to Libreview immediately when they arrive from
Libre 2 or 3 sensors. This is only useful in combination with
LibreLinkUp. To make use of it you need to add a LibrelinkUp
connection to this Libreview account in one of Abbott's Libre apps
(you don't need to use it for anything else). Sometimes the value is
not immediately visible, because display of <span style="font-weight: normal">LibreLinkUp</span>
isn't redrawn automatically. Using LibreLinkup is quite dangerous if
you don't look closely, because when you touch the graph, it shows an
old value instead of the current glucose value.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Spy Views</b>:
When this option is set, Juggluco will send to Libreview whether a
value is viewed or not. When this option is turned off, Juggluco will
always say that it is not viewed. This option will only reliably send
this information to Libreview when also <i>Immediate</i> is turned
on. Juggluco should be constantly connected to the internet to catch
all views from Libre 3, Libre 2 remembers them all as long as it is
not killed.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Resend data</b>:
Start anew; resend data of the last 90 days to Libreview. You need to
press this when switching to a new Libreview account.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Result of the last
time trying to send to Libreview is displayed below the &quot;Get
Account ID&quot; button.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Because the values
sent to Libreview are first transformed to one data point in every 15
minutes and then analyzed, there can be small differences between the
values shown in Juggluco's statistics screen and Libreview. For
example Libreview says 100% of the time active, while Juggluco's
statistics screen says 96.0%. Also some high and low values will be
averaged away, so that Libreview gives a somewhat higher <i>time in
target </i>than the statistics screen of Juggluco. Because the
history values created on the sensors are less extreme than the
average of the stream values around a history value, this difference
will be larger when Libreview is based on the <i>history</i> values
as when &quot;Bluetooth History&quot; is enabled in Juggluco or
Librelink is used.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Juggluco can be
connected with multiple sensors at the same time, while Librelink
only handles one sensor at a time. Juggluco also sends data from only
one sensor at a time to Libreview. It does this by first sending the
data from one sensor and only after no data is available from that
sensor, it sends the data from the following sensor. When Juggluco is
switched to a following sensor, Juggluco will not turn back to a
previous one, to imitate the one sensor policy of Librelink. This
means that when you run multiple sensors at a time and a later added
one ends earlier than an earlier added sensor, this earlier sensor
will send no data anymore to Libreview.</p>
<p><b>Get Account ID</b>: If you only want to receive the LibreView
account ID, but not send data to Libreview, you can fill in your
E-Mail address and Password and press on &quot;<i>Get Account ID</i>&quot;.
On the same line before this button, the Account ID will be shown
(this can take some time and the screen is not refreshed
automatically). Retrieving the Account ID from the LibreView server
makes it possible to use a FreeStyle Libre 3 sensor that was already
used with Abbotts Libre 3 app with this LibreView account.</p>
<p><b>WARNING</b>: The Freestyle Libre 3 sensor should be activated
with this account.<br/>
