<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1>Upload to Nightscout server</h1>
<p>In most cases you can also use the <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/Nightscouthelp.html">web
server in Juggluco</a> or <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/cmdline">juggluco-server</a>.
Only a few apps, that do nothing more than displaying the Nightscout
web page, need <a href="https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor">cgm-remote-monitor</a>.
You can even use AAPS and AAPSClient with the web server in Juggluco
7.4.1.</p>
<p>All stream values are uploaded to the Nightscout server at the
moment they arrive. When multiple sensor are used, all values of all
sensors are uploaded. Some Garmin watch apps/faces/widgets assume
that the values are space 5 minutes apart. When they receive glucose
values one minute apart, they will only show the last fifth of the
curve. For that reason, the webserver incorporated in Juggluco spaces
the values 5 minutes apart, except when &quot;interval=secs&quot; is
set to a lower value.</p>
<p><b>URL</b>: the url should be in the form of https://hostname:port
for example, https://myname.herokuapp.com:6789</p>
<p><b>Active</b>: Turn on uploader</p>
<p><b>test V3</b>: Let Juggluco use api/v3 to upload to Nightscout.
Don’t use it to upload to a Nightscout server that previously
received V2 uploads and don’t send V2 uploads to a Nightscout
server that previously received V3 uploads. 
</p>
<p><b>Give Amounts</b>: Also send amounts as treatments to
Nightscout. Touching the checkbox brings you to a dialog in which you
can specify for every label what it means in Nightscout. These
specifications are shared with web server in Juggluco (<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/Nightscouthelp.html">Left
menu→Settings→Web server</a>). Only when all labels are handled,
can you check “<i>Give Amounts</i>”. If you later add a new
label, you have to remember yourself to specify what to do with it.
<span lang="en-US">Because of a bug in <a href="https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor">Nightscout</a>,
insertions at older time periods or deletions are only shown after
items with a new time are added. This means that it is better to send
less often to Nightscout. Now it is done every time the user switches
away from Juggluco by turning off the display or going to another
app.</span></p>
<p><b>Resend data</b>: Upload all data again to the Nightscout server</p>
<p><b>Send now</b>: Normally data is immediately send when it arrives
from the sensor or a mirror connection. Press on this button when for
some reason a previous attempt failed.</p>
<p>The WearOS version Juggluco 4.15.0 and later can also upload
glucose values to Nightscout. In nearly all cases you can better send
them via a Juggluco version on a phone or tablet or via Juggluco
server on a computer. It will drain the battery, especially when it
is unable to contact the Nightscout server, so you can better turn
<i>Active</i> off when there is no reliable connection.</p>
