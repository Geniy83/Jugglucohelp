<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1 class="western">Settings</h1>
<h2 class="western">Unit</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Select whether glucose values should be
given in mmol/L or dm/dL.</p>
<h2 class="western">Graph range: low-high.</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Give a low and high value, so that the
bottom of the screen correspondents to the lowest and the top to the
highest. These values are only used when all the glucose values
displayed on the screen are within these bounds. Otherwise, the
bounds are widened so that all values are visible. When you take 3
mmol/L (54 mg/dL) and 9 mmol/L (162 mg/dL), and all the values on the
visible display are between 5 mmol/L and 6 mmol/L, the graph displays
a glucose axis from 3 to 9. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">If <b>Manually scale Glucose</b> is
turned on, you can change this: moving your finger over the top of
the screen, moves the top half of the graph up and down; moving over
the bottom of the screen moves the bottom half of the graph up and
down.</p>
<h2 class="western">Target range: low-high</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The higher side of the display is
colored differently so you can see high values easier. The same is
true for low values. A red line is displayed to show the too low side
of the display.</p>
<h2 class="western">Glucose-axis numbers LEFT</h2>
<p>Place the numbers of the glucose level in the graph on the left of
the screen. Useful if you want to place your current glucose in the
middle of the screen, for example in Wear OS.</p>
<h2 class="western">Threshold</h2>
<p>Apply a threshold to the rate of change of glucose values. Only
when the rate of change diverges the specified amount from 0 is the
rate of change arrow different from horizontal. You can use arbitrary
values between 0 and 0.8. The threshold is used to prevent giving to
much meaning to small absolute rate of change values. It is very well
possible that the rate of change show a slowly rising glucose value,
but in reality it is falling. The threshold is used to make a more
cautious statement.</p>
<h2 class="western">Invert screen</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Turn the display upside down. It is
switched on by default, because otherwise I'd sometimes
accidentally touch OK while scanning a sensor.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Some people ask for portrait mode, but
I have turned that off, because it is totally inappropriate for the
display of the glucose graph.</p>
<h2 class="western">NFC sound</h2>
<p>Make sound during scanning in addition to vibration.</p>
<h2 class="western">Scanning starts app</h2>
<p>If checked this app will be started when you scan a sensor via NFC
even if this app is not displayed. If multiple apps have this
setting, android will display a chooser from which to select which
app you want to use. Somehow choosing one doesn't work and selecting
one to be chosen the next time neither. So in this case you can't
scan without an app in the foreground. Turning it off in this app,
will make it possible that at least one app can be activated this
way.</p>
<p>If you have root access, you can also disable NFC activation of
Abbott's Librelink app (doesn't work with Libre3):</p>
<p>Become root in adb shell or termux, and type:</p>
<p>pm disable
com.freestylelibre.app.nl/com.librelink.app.ui.common.NFCScanActivity</p>
<p>On Librelink 2.7.1 and lower you had to press:</p>
<p>pm disable
com.freestylelibre.app.nl/com.librelink.app.ui.common.ScanSensorActivity</p>
<p>com.freestylelibre.app.nl is here the Dutch version of Librelink,
this should be replaced with the version you are using. You can find
its name by typing (even without root):</p>
<p>pm list package freestylelibre</p>
<p>Afterwards, you can still use Librelink for scanning when it is in
the foreground, but it will not be started otherwise. Librelink 2.5.2
and higher crash themselves if they detect root. But in Magisk you
can easily hide root by renaming Magisk and adding individual apps to
the denylist (Magisk 24.3) or Magiskhide (Magisk 23.0). You should
also add Juggluco to the denylist. Except when you use US Freestyle
Libre 2 sensors, you can also use an older version of Librelink
without root check.</p>
<p>Without root, under adb shell, you can also disable the whole app:</p>
<p>pm disable-user --user 0 com.freestylelibre.app.nl</p>
<p>Before calling Abbott customer service, you can re-enable it with:</p>
<p>pm enable com.freestylelibre.app.nl</p>
<h2 class="western">Health Connect</h2>
<p>Send minutely glucose values to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.healthdata">Health
Connect</a>. You can give other app access to these glucose values,
for example <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fitness">Google
Fit</a>. Other apps again can get assess to data from Google Fit.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/libreview.html">Libreview</a></h2>
<p>Connect with Libreview to send Freestyle Libre 2 and 3 glucose
values and amounts to Libreview and to get the account id used during
Freestyle Libre 3 sensor activation. Touch to change settings.</p>
<h2 class="western">Patched Libre</h2>
<p>Use the Patched Libre broadcast (originally send by the patched
German Librelink app 2.3.0), to send the Bluetooth glucose stream
data every minute to xDrip. In xDrip you need to set Libre2 (patched
App) as hardware data source. The glucose values displayed in xDrip
are different from the values it receives. For some reason xDrip only
updates its value every 5 minutes, probably because it was made for
devices that send only once per 5 minutes (A watch face connected to
xDrip regularly displayed more than 9 minute old values.) In
addition, xDrip displays its own interpretation of received glucose
values. Mirror devices can also sent to xDrip.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/jakobheyman/xdripJH">https://github.com/jakobheyman/xdripJH</a>
for an attempt to update the glucose value of xDrip every minute.</p>
<p>Freestyle Libre 3 sensors send missed values after a disconnection
period. These values are not sent with this broadcast. You will
receive them if you turn on the Web server in Juggluco and make xDrip
a Nightscout follower of Juggluco. Nightscout server:
http://127.0.0.1:17580</p>
<p>Juggluco can also directly contact with xDrip watch apps, so that
the watch app displays more recent glucose values. To use this
feature check <i>&quot;xDrip webserver&quot;</i> in the left menu
under <b>Watch</b>. See Help under left menu-&gt;<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/watchinfo.html">Watch</a>
for more information. Only one app can listen to the network port
used by the xDrip webserver, so you need to turn off &quot;<i>xDrip
webservice</i>&quot; in xDrip itself if you want to make use of the
one in Juggluco.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="eversense"></a>EverSense</h2>
<p>Yet another glucose broadcast. It can be used to send every minute
a glucose value to xDrip. xDrip will ignore nearly all of them
because of its insistence on one value in 5 minutes. You can remove
this restriction by editing the source code of xDrip. Change <i>4 *
60 * 1000</i> to <i>55 * 1000</i> in
<a href="https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/blob/645e8b4cb8fa3ad7b280f598d6f2f6bdb84ce392/app/src/main/java/com/eveningoutpost/dexdrip/models/BgReading.java#L969">app/src/main/java/com/eveningoutpost/dexdrip/models/BgReading.java</a>,
so that it becomes:</p>
<p>public static BgReading readingNearTimeStamp(long startTime)
{<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long
margin = (55 * 1000);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return
readingNearTimeStamp(startTime, margin);<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>
<p>The advantage over the Patched Libre broadcast is, that xDrip
doesn’t transform the glucose values in some unspecified manner.</p>
<h2 class="western">xDrip broadcast</h2>
<p>Send the same broadcast as turned on in xDrip with
&quot;<i>Settings-&gt;Inter-app settings-&gt;Broadcast locally&quot;</i>.
Apps like AndroidAPS listen to it. Unlike the original xDrip
broadcast which was broadcast every 5 minutes, Juggluco broadcasts
this broadcast every minute.</p>
<h2 class="western">Glucodata broadcast</h2>
<p>A new broadcast that has the same function as the xDrip broadcast.
A simple example app that writes received glucose values to logcat
you can find here: <a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Juggluco/glucosebroadcast.html">Glucose
broadcasts</a>. If you specify Juggluco as data-source in G-Watch,
you need to turn on this broadcast.</p>
<p>The application apps listening to this broadcast are shown. Check
the apps you want to send this broadcast to.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/Nightscouthelp.html">Web
server</a></h2>
<p>Web server that can be used with xDrip watches and some Nightscout
apps. Previously called xDrip webserver.</p>
<h2 class="western">Insulin onboard (IOB)</h2>
<p>IOB is a measure of how much insulin remains from previous insulin
doses. To do this, you must enter insulin doses under a label in the
“<i>Rapid acting insulin</i>” category. You can specify what
labels are “<i>Rapid acting insulin</i>” under Left
menu→Settings→Web server→<a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/setlibrenumtype.html">Give
Amounts</a>.</p>
<h2 class="western">Now clamp</h2>
<p>When “<i>Now clamp</i>” is set, the time period displayed on
the screen is scrolled to the left so that the present is always at
the same point of the screen. Some users run Juggluco on an Android
emulator on a computer at a few meter distance from them. When “<i>Now
clamp</i>” is turned off, the location of the current glucose value
would move to the right with the passage of time, so that after a few
hours it isn’t visible anymore. This makes it necessary to walk to
the computer and scroll the screen a few centimeter. When “<i>Now
clamp</i>” is turned on, this distraction is no longer required.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/NightPost.html">Uploader</a></h2>
<p>Upload to a Nightscout server.</p>
<h2 class="western">Glucose notification</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">(Previously called &quot;<i>Glucose in
android status bar</i>&quot;). If set, glucose values streaming via
Bluetooth are quietly displayed in a notification and the android
status bar. If you turn it off, instead of a number, a dot is shown
and the notification tells nothing more than &quot;<i>To connect to
sensor</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>To exchange data</i>&quot;. An app that
stays running in the background, is obliged by Android to have such
visible notification (otherwise it is easily stopped by Android).
Juggluco only turns off the notification, when &quot;<i>Sensor via
Bluetooth</i>&quot; is turned off and there are no mirror
connections.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">On some smartphones, the glucose value
is only shown in the Android status bar after changing Androids
notification settings. On Realme GT 5G for example, you have to go to
applist-&gt;Juggluco-&gt;manage notifications, tab on
glucoseNotification and turn off &quot;Set to Silent&quot;. &quot;Display
in status bar&quot; will now be shown turned on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">You can also get an android
notification by selecting <i>Notify</i> in the left middle menu. In
that case the notification will be sent to some smartwatches, if it
is configured that way. That works with Garmin watches, I don't know
if it works with anything else. Alarms also generate notifications.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/floatingconfig.html" onclick="location.href=this.href+'?unit='+unitstr;return false;">Floating
glucose</a></h2>
<p>When you turn this on, a small image with the current glucose
value is constantly present on the screen independent of which app is
in the foreground. If you turn it on the first time, you will be
directed to a list of apps in which you have to give Juggluco
permission to <b>display over other apps</b>.</p>
<h2 class="western">Sensor via Bluetooth</h2>
<p>Selects whether this app connects via Bluetooth with a Freestyle
Libre 2 or 3 sensor. This is needed for alarms and continuous glucose
monitoring.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/alarmhelp.html">Alarms</a></h2>
<p>Set high en low glucose alarms, loss of signal alarm and value
available notification.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/labelhelp.html">Number
labels</a></h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Specify the labels used for amounts. Go
to a screen to determine which labels to use to set amounts, like
insulin doses, carbohydrate consumption and hours spend playing
football. If you also use the Garmin watch app Kerfstok, these labels
are sent to the watch app.</p>
<h2 class="western">Language</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Juggluco is displayed in the chosen
language. When no language code is selected, the system language is
used.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/reminders.html">Reminders</a></h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Specify that an alarm should go of if
you didn't enter a certain amount of food or medication within a
certain time period.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a href="https://www.juggluco.nl/Jugglucohelp/colorhelp.html">Colors</a></h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Change colors of curves, scans and
numbers. To switch <i>Dark mode</i>, use right middle menu-&gt;Dark
mode.</p>
<h2 class="western"><br/>
